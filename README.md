# GladianCompiler
An application for recording and translating between a runic system using a 5x5 grid

All images are required to stay in the same hierarchy to run
data is saved in a generated file 'compiled.dat' in the form:
{key},{name} where key represents the content of the glyph, and name is the tag associated with it
this file can be transfered between instances of the application, but must be in the same folder as the exe/py to be read
